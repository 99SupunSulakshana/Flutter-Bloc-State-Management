Bloc stands for Business Logic Component. It's an architectural pattern used in Flutter to manage an application's flow data and state and business logic. It provides a structured way to separate the presentation layer(UI) from the business logic layer. As a result, this helps in developing more maintainable, testable, and scalable Flutter apps. Bloc architecture is often used to create reactive and high-performance applications. Bloc architecture is well-suited for managing complex and asynchronous data flow in flutter applications. It enables developers to maintain a clear separation of concerns. This as a consequence, makes code easier to maintain, extend, and debug. Using Bloc you can build high-performance mobile apps that respond efficiently to user interactions.

# Business Logic
  - The core logic and functionality of the Flutter application reside within Blocs. It contains tasks like data fetching, transformation, validations, and any other operations that are not directly related to the UI by isolating business logic, it becomes easier for flutter developers to reuse and test.

# Events

  - In Bloc, developers can initiate changes or actions by sending events to the Bloc. Events are essentially user interactions or triggers, such as button clicks, text input, or network requests. These events represent what should happen next in your app. Thus, it helps in creating intelligent algorithms in the app.

# states

  - Bloc emits state in response to events. These states represent the different snapshots or states of your application's UI and data. Each state represents a specific view and changes in state trigger UI updates.

# Streams and Sinks

  - Bloc uses the concept of streams and sinks to handle asynchronous data flow. Events are added to a sink and the Bloc emits states through a stream. Consequently, this allows for real-time updates and reactivity in your app.

# StreamBuilder

   - In the flutter UI layer, developers generally use a "StreamBuilder" widget to listen to the stream of states emitted by the Bloc. This widget automatically rebuilds the UI when new states are emitted. So, it ensures that the user interface reflects the current application state.

# Dependency Injection

  - To keep Bloc, decoupled and testable, dependency injection is used to provide external dependencies. This includes data repositories or services to the Bloc. Popular dependency injection libraries like get_it or provider are commonly used in conjunction with Bloc.

# Testing 

  - Bloc architecture also supports testing. You can write unit tests for your Bloc logic to ensure that it behaves as expected, independently of the UI. Additionally, You can perform widget tests and integration tests to verify how Blocs interact with the UI.
