Bloc stands for Business Logic Component. It's an architectural pattern used in Flutter for managing the flow data, state and business logic in an application. It provides a structured way to separate the presentation layer(UI) from the business logic layer. As a result, this helps in developing more maintainable, testable, and scalable Flutter apps. Bloc architecture is often used to create reactive and high-performance applications. Bloc architecture is particularly well-suited for managing complex and asynchronous data flow in flutter applications. It enables developers to maintain a clear separation of concerns. This as a consequence, makes code easier to maintain, extend, and debug. Using Bloc you can build high-performance mobile apps that respond efficiently to user interactions.
